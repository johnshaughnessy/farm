TODO :

Use cute fish asset from asset store to create a glowing blimpfish.

	> Change base color to match farm's color pallete
	> Create 4x black-and-white copies of the fish texture, each highlighting a separate stripe
	> Write a shader who computes the color of each pixel via the following linear combination:
	  	pixelColor = baseColor + glow1*texture1 + glow2*texture2 + glow3*texture3 + glow4*texture4
	  where pixelColor == end color of the pixel
	  		glow       == color value coordinated w/ music
	  		texture    == color value on stripe texture 1/2/3/4 (white or black)
	> Create koreographer track for blimp fish
	> Subscribe to koreographer track, set glow values accordingly

SUMMARY : 

This was a success, although there a couple of issues with the shader.
	> top fin of the fish is lighter than the other
	> top of the fin is orange, not transparent
	> music box script became complicated. 
	  perhaps it shouldn't be the _same_ script as the music boxes
